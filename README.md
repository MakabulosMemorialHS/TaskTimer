# TaskTimer
A simple Pomodoro Technique timer.

This is a working version. I use this timer quite often
sometime ago. Today I have a pomodoro timer on my android
phone so I don't use it that often anymore.

I am putting the source code here so that I am reminded of it and
thus possibly take the time to improve it.

This timer is based on Qt. Do the usual Qt-fu to compile
this thing.
